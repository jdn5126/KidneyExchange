# KidneyExchange

## Execution
The Kidney Exchange program is a Java application that requires at least JRE 1.8 installed to run. Driver scripts are provided for both PowerShell and Bash. The former is useful for Windows users, whereas the latter is most likely to be used by Linux users (though WSL users can use this as well).

### PowerShell
To run the PowerShell driver, open a PowerShell window, change into the directory containing this README, and run the following:

```powershell
.\Invoke-KidneyExchange.ps1
```

The `Get-Help` cmdlet can be used to get information on the driver's command line options.


### Bash
To run the Bash driver, open a Bash prompt, change into the directory containing this README, and run the following:

```bash
./kidney-exchange.sh
```

The `-h` option can be used to get information on the driver's command line options.
